USING CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSES

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below.

Considerations for licensors:
- Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights.
- Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions before applying them.
- Licensors should secure all rights necessary and clearly mark any material not subject to the license.

Considerations for the public:
- A licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under the license terms.
- If a use is permitted under an exception or limitation to copyright, the license does not apply.
- The license only grants permissions under rights the licensor has authority over.
