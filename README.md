# project-tv

Welcome to **project-tv** — the third iteration of my experimental web project formerly known as *TvGarden*.

## 🌍 About

**project-tv** is a creative exploration of public broadcasting. The idea is to create an interactive website that displays **live TV channels** that are publicly streamed on **YouTube** and potentially other streaming sources in the future.

The core feature is a **3D globe interface** that allows users to explore and tune into different public broadcasting channels from around the world.

> _Note: "project-tv" is currently a working title and may change in the future._
